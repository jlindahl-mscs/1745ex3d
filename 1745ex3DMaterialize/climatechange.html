            <h4>Climage Change</h4>

            <p>
                Climate change has become a bigger deal lately and is affecting all of us and our surroundings.
                Some of these changes might be more noticeable and more dramatic than other climate issues.
                Some of these issues have been there without us really noticing until it’s almost too late for
                us to do anything about the situation. Many animal species are being affected and are endangered
                or vulnerable because of what us humans do in our daily lives that affect our environment.
                We are hurting our environment by dumping toxic wastes into our oceans, which this hurts the
                underwater world habitats and what they eat. Lack of food happens and the fish and animals
                underwater starve to death and lowers their population until they are all in serious trouble
                or they are already categorized in the endangered list.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our forests are burning and our lakes and rivers are drying out from
                intense heat waves that are getting worse and worse. This is because of
                our temperatures changing and our planet warming up. Places such as
                Antarctica are defrosting because of temperature changes and the
                temperatures being unusually higher than the years before. These
                changes might sound minor to some people but this can affect our way of life
                and our whole planet and cause major changes to our environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                These affects the amount of oxygen that our planet is getting.
                Wildfires are becoming more and more frequent. In 2018 more than 58,083 wildfires,
                and more than 8,8 million acres were burnt. Our waters are being contaminated by
                all the litter that ends up in our oceans and bodies of water.
            </p>
            <p>
                Greta Thunberg, a climate activist, said in her speech " people are suffering,people are dying,
                entire ecosystems are collapsing, we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk
                about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth." She is right, we are destroying our own
                home to the point where we might not be able to fix things back to normal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Climate change is becoming a bigger deal and we need to do something about our planet before the damage is completely irreversible.
                We have already done so much to the earth that we need to do something about it now before we can't go back.
            </p>
